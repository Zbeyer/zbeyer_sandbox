Playing around...
Revived a few Towne Of Klock related projects with Kyle Savchuk
  isoHex project is a lame name to experiment with turning pixel art into a game.
  Tried HTML Canvas / Javascript - 

  Art used in this example (Thus far) mostly produced by Kyle Savchuk, co-author of Towne Of Klock

  Spent a day computing relationship of the isometric hexegons sitting inside of sprites
  Spent an hour coding in Javascript
